        :param start_rating_generator:
            Class object for generating start rating (the rating a player receives in its very first match).

        :param performance_predictor:
            Class object for predicting performance of a player in a match.
        This is used to adjust for the current quality of opponents faced or other contexts dependant on the class used.

        :param rating_change_multiplier:
            The base multiplier for how much a player's rating changes after a match.
            Equivalent of the K-factor in Elo.


        :param confidence_days_ago_multiplier:
            Determinutes how much the confidence_sum is affected by how long ago the last match was.
            If a player has not played in a long time, the confidence in a players rating declines.
            This means his future rating changes faster. A higher confidence_days_ago_multiplier  therefore leads to more volatile future rating changes.

        :param confidence_max_days:
            A players confidence_sum decreases by confidence_days_ago_multiplier * min(confidence_max_days, days_ago_since_last_match).
            confidence_max_days therefore puts a limit on how much a players confidence_sum can decrease.
            This ensures a non-linear relationship between inactivity and our confidence in a players rating.

        :param confidence_value_denom:
            Higher confidence_value_denom results in a more volatile rating change multipler based on the confidence_sum.

        :param confidence_max_sum:
            The maximum confidence_sum a player can have.
             If confidence_max_sum is very high, a player with many historical games, can be inactive for a while and still have a high confidence_sum.
             Thus a lower confidence_max_sum increases the speed at which a players confidence_sum decreases when inactive.


        :param min_rating_change_multiplier_ratio:
            To ensure that a player's rating changes at least a little bit after a match,
            min_rating_change_multiplier_ratio ensures that the applied_rating_change_multiplier is at least a certain ratio of the rating_change_multiplier.

        :param confidence_weight:
            Determines how much the applied rating change multiplier is affected by the confidence_sum.
            The confidence_sum being how much data (and how recent) we have on a player.
            If the confidence_ratio is 0, the applied rating_change_multipler is equal to the rating_change_multiplier.
            The higher ratio it is, the more volatile the applied rating_change_multiplier is based on the data we have on a player.
            Recommended is between 0.7 and 1.0

        :param league_rating_change_update_threshold:
            All players within a league gets their rating updated when the sum of all rating changes within a league exceeds this threshold.
            A lower value means that the ratings within a league are updated more often but is more computationally expensive.

        :param league_rating_adjustor_multiplier:
            The amount of which the players within a league gets their rating updated with, is league_rating_adjustor_multiplier * mean_rating_change.
            A higher value makes the performance of other players within a league have a larger impact on a players rating - even if the player hasn't played a match.
