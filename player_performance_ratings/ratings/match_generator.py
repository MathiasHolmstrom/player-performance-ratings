    Converts a dataframe to a list of matches.

    Dataframe needs to be sorted by date, game_id, team_id in ascending order.

    The participation_weight indicates the percentage (as a ratio) of the time played by the player in the match.
    The league column indicates the league of the match.
    If the league_identifier is passed it will identify the league of the match by the players past matches played.
